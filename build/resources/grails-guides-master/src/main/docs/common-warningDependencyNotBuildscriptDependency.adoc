WARNING: Be sure to add the dependency to the `dependencies` section of the `build.gradle` file, and not the `buildscript`/`dependencies` section. The former is for application dependencies (needed for at compile time, runtime, or testing), whereas the `buildscript` `dependencies` is for those needed as part of the Gradle build process (managing static assets, for example).
