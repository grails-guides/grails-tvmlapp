To create a TVML application and connect it to a Grails Server we need to modify the variables `tvBaseURL` and `tvBootURL`.

Create a TvOS project with the TVML application template.

Choose Swift as the language.

Add a new value _App Transport Security Settings_ (case sensitive), and as its child, add _Allow Arbitrary Loads_, and set that value to YES.

NOTE: Adding this key to your Info.plist is necessary because as of iOS 9, your app will prevent linking to non-HTTPS servers to encourage best practices. In this tutorial, you’ll be testing against a local server without HTTPS enabled, so you’ll disable the default behavior.

Modify `AppDelegate.swift` and set the static variables `tvBaseURL` and `tvBootURL`.

[source,swift]
----
static let tvBaseURL = "http://localhost:8080/"
static let tvBootURL = "\(AppDelegate.tvBaseURL)/assets/application.js"
----
